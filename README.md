My name is Giuliano I'm a software engineer very passionate about science and tech to empower, elevate people and make everyday things easy. I've got a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Science, Computer Science and Telecommunications. I enjoy making new friends and talking random stuff with colleagues with a slice of cake and a coffee at the terrace.

Some things I enjoy working with include Django (Python), CI/CD tools to automate everything, and AI.
